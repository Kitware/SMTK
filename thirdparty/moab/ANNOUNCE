ANNOUNCING THE LGPL RELEASE OF MOAB

MOAB, a Mesh-Oriented datABase, is a software component for creating,
storing and accessing finite element mesh data.  MOAB is being
designed in close collaboration with the SciDAC Terascale Simulation
Tools and Technologies (TSTT) Center and with the CUBIT project at
Sandia National Laboratories.

A few highlights of the capabilities in MOAB include:

* Representation of 0-3d elements in the finite element "zoo"
  (including support for quadratic elements), as well as support for
  polygon and polyhedron entities

* Highly efficient storage and query of structured and unstructured
  mesh (e.g. a brick-shaped hex mesh requires approximately 25 and 55 MB
  per million hex elements in the structured and unstructured
  representations, respectively)

* Powerful data model allowing representation of various metadata in
  the form of "sets" (arbitrary groupings of mesh entities and sets) and
  "tags" (annotation of entities, sets, and entire mesh)

* Open source (LGPL) mesh readers/writers for Sandia ExodusII,
  CUBIT .cub save/restore, VTK, and other mesh formats

* Implementation of the DOE Scidac TSTT center's mesh interface (see
  www.tstt-scidac.org for more details of this interface)

MOAB is available under an LGPL license from Sandia National
Laboratories.  More information, including instructions for
