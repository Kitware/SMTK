mcnpmit (MCNP Mesh Interpolation Tool)

Takes a modified MCNP meshtal file (source) and a provided set
of points or a IDEAS .unv mesh (target) and interpolates the
tally values of the source mesh onto the target mesh, output in
a list of points and if a .unv file is read, a cooresponding .h5m
or .vtk file.

Syntax

./mcnpmit <source_mesh> <target_mesh> <output_file>

source_mesh: is one of two options:

(1) A modified MCNP meshtal file.  The format is as follows:

Title card
Single entry stating coordinate system: "Box" or "Cylindrical"
"Rotation Matrix:"
4x4 rotation matrix (one row on each line)
The rest of the standard file...

(2) A .h5m file which is generated after running the program.  It
will be called <source_mesh>.h5m

target_mesh: is one of two options:

(1) A list of vertex points in .qsv format

(2) A .unv mesh file.  Note that if this is used, a .vtk file
called <target_mesh>.vtk is generated with the interpolated data.

output_file: the name of the output file.
