# - Try to find Remus headers and libraries
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(Remus)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  REMUS_ROOT_DIR  Set this variable to the root installation of
#                            Remus if the module has problems finding
#                            the proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  REMUS_FOUND              System has Remus libs/headers
#  REMUS_INCLUDE_DIRS        The location of Remus headers
