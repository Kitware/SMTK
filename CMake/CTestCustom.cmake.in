  # For *NIX builds, MOAB does not generate export headers. Instead, it builds
  # its libraries with default (i.e. public) visibility. SMTK builds with hidden
  # visibility, so on MacOS we get warnings that match the following pattern
  # where SMTK directly access symbols from the MOAB library. As of 03/19/2019,
  # there is no plan to add symbol exporting to MOAB. Thus, we ignore these
  # warnings.
  "warning: direct access in function .* to global weak symbol 'typeinfo for moab::.* means the weak symbol cannot be overridden at runtime\\. This was likely caused by different translation units being compiled with different visibility settings\\."
