Bridge a new modeling kernel

This tutorial covers how to session a solid modeling kernel to SMTK.
The details will vary according to the capabilities of the modeling
kernel you wish to use via SMTK, but the overall process of bridging
the kernel involves

* subclassing SMTK's :smtk:`Session` class â€” which is used as a
  session between the modeling kernel and SMTK's model manager;
* defining a map between your kernel's modeling entities and SMTK UUIDs;
* transcribing information about kernel modeling entities into an
  SMTK model manager; and
* providing SMTK operators which perform modeling operations. The only
  mandatory operator is a "read" operator used to load a file native
  to your modeling kernel into your native kernel's modeling session.

This tutorial will add a simplistic session type that presents an Exodus
mesh as a model composed only of groups (element blocks, side sets,
and node sets).
A session like this is useful for cases where the geometry for a
simulation has been completely prepared and SMTK is only being
used to attach attributes to pre-existing subsets of the geometric
model.
The groups themselves have a tessellation (i.e., a graphical representation)
based on the cells they contain but the groups do not expose any of
these cells to SMTK.

Our example session uses VTK's Exodus reader to load files and
obtain a tessellation for each element block, side set, and node set.
