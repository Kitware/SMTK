Administering SMTK
******************

Previous sections covered the concepts and tools for using SMTK.
This section is for system administrators who wish to make SMTK
available to users

* as a Python module and command-line utilities for end users of SMTK, and/or
* as a library for people developing SMTK-based applications.

End-user tool installation
==========================

This type of installation should be as simple as downloading a
binary package of SMTK and clicking install.

.. todo:: Expand on details of installation and configuration.

Developer installation
======================

In addition to the binary installer, there should also be a development
package that contains header and configuration files needed to build
C++ applications using SMTK. Install this the same way you installed
the binary above.

You can also download the source code from the git repostory and
follow the instructions for building and installing SMTK in the
toplevel :file:`ReadMe.md` file.
