SMTK's Workflow System
----------------------

SMTK's workflow system is aimed at providing guidance to
users on tasks required to complete the simulation preparation
process.

Simulations can require input from many people with different skill sets.
People with backgrounds in engineering; physical modeling; geometric discretization;
numerical analysis; visualization and data analysis; statistics; and project management
may all be involved, each with different tasks to complete.
SMTK accommodates this range of interests and tasks by providing applications
with ways to prompt users, especially infrequent or inexpert users, with
suggested actions.
