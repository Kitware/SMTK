Session: Exodus
---------------

SMTK has a session type named *exodus* that is not technically a modeling kernel
but does allow you to mark up meshes saved in the Exodus-II_ file format for use
in an existing simulation â€” assuming that element blocks and side sets that
segregate the model into one or more regions per material and one or more
groups per boundary-condition are already present in the exodus mesh.

.. todo:: Describe what blocks and sets are
.. todo:: Describe how blocks and sets are mapped to models and groups
.. todo:: Show simple example?
