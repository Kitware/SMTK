Obtaining, Building, and Installing
-----------------------------------

For instructions on obtaining, building, and installing
SMTK, clone the repository:

.. code:: sh

   git clone https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmb/smtk.git

and follow the instructions in the :file:`doc/dev/build.md`
file in the source code. Other files in that directory
describe our development process and are relevant if you
intend to contribute source code to SMTK.
The rest of this user's guide assumes you have built
and installed SMTK according to these instructions.

In addition to cloning anonymously as mentioned above,
you are also welcome to create an account on either
gitlab.kitware.com or github.com and fork the repository.
Forking the repository will allow you to submit contributions
back to SMTK for inclusion in later releases.
See :ref:`smtk-contributing` for more on how to
prepare and submit changes to SMTK.
