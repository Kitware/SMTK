SMTK's Extensions
-----------------

The core SMTK library has few dependencies on external projects.
However there are external projects that SMTK can either make use
of or can be of use to.
The :file:`extension` directory in SMTK provides additional libraries
that introduce dependencies on external projects but which provide
additional functionality.
