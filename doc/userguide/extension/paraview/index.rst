ParaView
========

SMTK provides ParaView plugins that, in concert with the VTK extensions, allow users to
load models and meshes in ParaView; perform selections and filtering on model entities;
run operations on models; and set attribute values by interacting with 3-D widgets.
These plugins form the core of the ModelBuilder application (version 6 and later).
