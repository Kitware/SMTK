SMTK's Task System
------------------

Simulations can require input from many people with different skill sets.
People with backgrounds in engineering; physical modeling; geometric discretization;
numerical analysis; visualization and data analysis; statistics; and project management
may all be involved, each with different tasks to complete.
SMTK accommodates this range of interests and tasks by providing applications
with ways to prompt users – especially infrequent or inexpert users – with
suggested tasks required to complete the portion of the design process.

These tasks, together with their inter-dependencies, form a
a graph with tasks as nodes and dependencies as arcs.
