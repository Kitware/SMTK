SMTK's Graph-based Model Resource
---------------------------------

An alternative to SMTK's geometric model resource is the
graph-based model resource.
Unlike the geometric model resource, which has a set of
fixed component types, the graph-based resource has a
user-defined set of components (nodes) and relationships (arcs)
between those components.
