SMTK's View System
------------------

One of the main functions of SMTK is to present attributes, models, and meshes
to users so that they can edit and annotate them.
The view system provides classes that aid with this task without depending
on any particular user interface technology (Qt, HTML+JavaScript, VTK, etc.).
