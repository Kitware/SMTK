Changes to operation parameter-editor panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new task style key ``hide-items`` was added to the panel for specifying
operation parameters to be hidden from the user interface when displayed.
The value is an array of strings, each specifying the path to one item
in the operation parameters.
