Project subsystem

New project shortcut changed
============================

Previously, `Ctrl+P` (`Cmd+P` on macos) would create a new project.
However, ParaView uses this key sequence for point-picking in render windows,
so now `Shift+Ctrl+P` (`Shift+Cmd+P` on macos) is used to create new projects.
