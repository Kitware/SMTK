Resource System

Template API
------------

The attribute-system methods to set and get a "template type" and "template version" have
been moved up to :smtk:`smtk::resource::Resource::templateType`
and :smtk:`smtk::resource::Resource::templateVersion` (along with their "set" methods).
See the user's guide for more information.
