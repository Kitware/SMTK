Expanding Attribute Resource's Query Grammar
--------------------------------------------

Attribute Resource's queryOperation now uses a Pegtl-based approach which now provides the following benefits:

* In addition to querying on Attribute Type, you can now also query based on Property and Property Value
* Type Query can now include Regular Expressions.

See the `attribute filter documentation`_ for more details and examples.
