# Changes to SMTK's ParaView extensions

+ There is now a toolbar button to start selecting components
  (in ParaView parlance, this is a block selection).
  The button is in SMTK's selection-filter toolbar at the far
  right. Clicking it will start a block selection in the currently
  active view.
