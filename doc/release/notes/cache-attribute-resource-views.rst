Preserve State Information
==========================

SMTK will now preserve state information that pertains to
Attribute Resource views.  The information persists even
after the resource has been closed, assuming the resource
was saved before it was closed.

Information Preserved:

- The active advance level.
- The active attributes in attribute views.
- The active tab in a group views.
