Dynamic initialization in plugins
---------------------------------

The CMake macro SMTK provides to create plugins
now uses a new feature in ParaView to ensure that
plugins are initialized properly in both Qt-based
GUI applications and python interpreters.

This should not require any changes to your code;
it simply changes the code generated by the `smtk_add_plugin()` macro.
Instead of generating a ParaView plugin with an
automatically-generated `pqAutoStartInterface` class,
it generates a ParaView plugin with
a `vtkPVDynamicInitializerPluginInterface` class which
calls a free function to initialize the plugin's registrars.
