## Support for python 3

We have added support for building and testing smtk's python bindings
for use with python 2 and 3. Python tests and examples included within
SMTK's source should hereafter be both Python 2 and Python 3-compliant.

### User-facing changes

Users can now build SMTK's python bindings using Python 3.
