## API Doxygen docs

A global pass to remove warnings generated by Doxygen during the
api-document generation process. Warnings about undocumented content
have been turned off, so developers should be able to generate documentation
and see what warnings their new code produces.

* Links to all common shared pointer typedefs refer to their contained type.
* Use a python package of git-lfs so readthedocs.io can see our pngs.
