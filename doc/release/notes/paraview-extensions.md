# ParaView Extensions

## Widgets

The box widget now accepts a single DoubleItem (with 6 entries)
specifying an axis-aligned bounding box or a GroupItem
containing multiple DoubleItems that configure a bounding box
in different ways depending on how they are used.
See the pqSMTKBoxItemWidget header for details.
