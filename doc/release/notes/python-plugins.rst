Python operations as modelbuilder plugins
-----------------------------------------

In the past, each time you ran modelbuilder and wanted to use
an operation written in Python, you would have to use the
"File→Import Operation…" menu item to register the operation.
Now you can add a small block to the bottom of your python
module and load it as a plugin in modelbuilder.
See :ref:`smtk-python-plugin` for the details.
