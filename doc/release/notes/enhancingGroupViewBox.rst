Saving Collapsible Group View Box State
---------------------------------------

The View now stores its open/close state within its configuration so
when it is rebuilt it knows if it should be open or closed.

Designers can also use this to set the initial state of the Group View.

The XML Attribute that controls this is called **Open** and is set to true or false.
