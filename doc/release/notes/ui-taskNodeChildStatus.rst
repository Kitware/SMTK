UI Changes
==========

Displaying the Child Status w/r to a qtTaskNode
-----------------------------------------------

qtTaskNode now prepends a solid folder Unicode character if a task currently contains children and a folder outline Unicode character if the task currently does not have children but would accept tasks generated by at least one available worklet as children or has internal ports.

In order to avoid code duplication, the *canAcceptWorklets* method was moved from the smtk::extension::qtTaskPath and is now part of smtk::task::Task.

An addition, the Font Awesome fonts (both regular and bold) have been added in order to display the appropriate Unicode characters. To use these fonts, set the font family to *Font Awesome 6 Free*.
