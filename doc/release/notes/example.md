## Example merge request note

Summarize the changes your merge request makes that are of interest
to other developers. If your change will also affect users of SMTK-based
applications, please consider splitting the note into two sections like so:

### Developer changes

Describe how your changes impact future developers.
Remember this is for the release notes;
it is not meant to describe internal changes but rather

+ new or changed best practices (e.g., use the new FooMacro everywhere)
+ new API methods developers may use
+ existing API whose effects are changed
+ changes to the build, test, installation, or packaging system.

### User-facing changes

Describe changes to new and existing users of SMTK applications here.
Do not assume users know obscure terminology or are already familiar with SMTK.
Feel free to include screenshots to clarify user interface changes.
