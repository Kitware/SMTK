## Preference to skip modified resource dialog

When a user closes a modified resource or exits the application with a
resource that is modified, a dialog is presented which asks the user
to save, discard, or cancel. Add a checkbox to the dialog that sets
the default response to this dialog, to save or discard the resource.

If the user changes their mind, the preference can be changed in the
Settings dialog.
