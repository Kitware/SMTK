# Genesis mesh files

## General

* cylinder.gen: a small file suitable for quick testing

## Casting

Three files that have been used to model simple casting problems with Truchas

* casting-mesh1.gen: Quarter section of spherical mold,
  4 element blocks & 14 side sets

* casting-mesh2.gen: Quarter section of spherical mold including casting,
  5 element blocks & 16 side sets

* casting-em-mesh: Quarter section of mesh enclosing either mesh 1/2,
  5 element blocks (including void for mesh1/2) & 0 side sets.


## High energy physics

These files are used at SLAC in conjunction with ACE3P simulation.

* gun-1fourth.gen: Quarter section of an RF gun, 1 element block & 5 side sets

* pillbox4.gen: Quarter section of single-cell cavity, 1 element block & 3 side sets
