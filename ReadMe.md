Introduction
============
The [Simulation Model Toolkit (SMTK)][SMTK] is an open-source, multi-platform toolkit for supporting simulation workflows by providing access to different modeling kernels, mesh databases, and simulation infomation (via its attribute system). SMTK is developed as part of the [Computational Model Builder (CMB)][CMB] effort and provides extensions for [ParaView][],
[Visualization Toolkit (VTK)][VTK] and [Qt][].

The project
has grown through collaborative efforts between [Kitware Inc.][Kitware],
 and various other
government and commercial institutions, and acedemic partners.
