      <BriefDescription>Split a model edge at the given point.</BriefDescription>
      <DetailedDescription>
        Split a model edge in two at the given point.

        The given point must be a non-model-vertex point of the model edge.
        If the model edge has no model vertices, the result will be a single
        new edge with the given point promoted to a model vertex.
        Otherwise 2 new edges are created.
        Regardless, the input edge is always destroyed; it is never modified.

        <BriefDescription>The edge to split.</BriefDescription>
        <DetailedDescription>
          This is a model edge containing at least one point that is not a model-vertex.
          The edge will be removed and replaced by one or two new edges whose endpoint(s)
          are the model vertex.

          When the input edge is a loop with no model vertices,
          then the result is a new edge that has the model vertex as both endpoints;
          otherwise, 2 new model edges will be created.
