/**\brief Task is a base class for all SMTK tasks.
  *
  * SMTK tasks are nodes in a graph whose arcs connect them to dependencies.
  * The state of each task and its dependencies determine the set of available
  * (or reachable) tasks.
  * An application's user interface typically gets reconfigured when the active
  * task changes to help direct users through a workflow, although tasks should
  * not attempt to modify the user interface themselves. Instead, tasks should
  * be solely focused on determining whether conditions are met for them to be
  * (a) accessible to users and (b) marked completed by users.
  * Once the first set of conditions is met, users are allowed to undertake the
  * task. Once the second set of conditions is met, users are allowed to mark
  * the task complete and thus gain access to those tasks which depend on it.
