/// A behavior for prompting the user to save resources before closing them.
/// Currently, this occurs in three places:
///
/// 1. A pipeline source is destroyed.
/// 2. A resource manager is removed from the server.
/// 3. The main window event manager has received a close event.
///
/// Absent from this list is the case when "File->Close Resource" is selected by
/// the user. This instance is handled by pqSMTKCloseResourceBehavior, which
/// additionally provides an option to cancel the close action. Of the three
/// instances where this behavior prompts to save before closing resources, only
/// the third instance is cancelable. The other two are connected to ParaView
/// signals that do not support cancelling the action.
