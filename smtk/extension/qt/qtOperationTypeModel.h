/**\brief A QAbstractListModel populated with SMTK operation types.
  *
  * The columns of the model are fixed by the Column enumeration.
  * Operations are ordered by their type index.
  * By using a QSortFilterProxyModel, you can subset and sort operations
  * using a variety of techniques.
  *
  * The class constructor accepts configuration via an
  * smtk::view::Information instance; it expects to find a
  * configuration component named "Model" in `info.configuration()->details()`.
  *
  * If you configure the model with a selection instance (i.e., if
  * the Information type-container holds a selection), then
  * it will add a selection observer that updates the Associability
  * column with a measure of how well each operation fits the current
  * selection.
  * The configuration should include either a "SelectionValueLabel" (string) or
  * a "SelectionValue" (integer), that indicate the value(s) in the selection
  * map which should be used to determine operation associability.
  * If "SelectionExact" (a boolean) is true, then only the exact number
  * specified by "SelectionValueLabel" or "SelectionValue" is accepted.
  * Otherwise, any value that has a superset of the selection-value's bits
  * is considered.
  *
  * By default, when a selection is provided the model will disable
  * actions in its WidgetAction column for operations with an associability
  * of GoodIncomplete or lower. You can override this with the
  * "DisableLevel" configuration attribute (see the example below).
  *
  * There are two ways to configure the model with an operation decorator:
  * 1. Insert a std::shared_ptr<OperationDecorator> into a
  *    std::shared_ptr<smtk::common::Managers> instance in the Information
  *    object passed to configure the model; or
  * 2. Include XML (deserialized into a Configuration::Component) that
  *    specifies the operation decorator.
  * If both are specified, the instance in the smtk::common::Managers
  * will take precedence.
  * Only operations that match entries in the decorator will be
  * presented â€“ and they may have their names, tool-tips, etc.
  * overridden.
  *
  * If you specify "Autorun" as true (the default is false), then
  * the model will launch operations automatically rather than
  * only emitting the runOperation() signal. (The runOperation()
  * signal will always be emitted.)
  *
  * Below is an example showing an XML configuration snippet
  * that can be included in a view::Configuration::Component
  * that will be used by the model.
  *
  * ```xml
  *   <Model
  *     DisableLevel="GoodIncomplete"
  *     SelectionValueLabel="selected"
  *     SelectionValue="1"
  *     SelectionExact="false"
  *     Autorun="false"
  *     >
  *     <OperationDecorator ... see class documentation for details ... />
  *   </Model>
  * ```
