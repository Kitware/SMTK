/**\brief Provides the QT UI for a Category-based Selection View.
  *
  * A Category-based Selector View is similar to a Group View in that it is a set of Views.
  * However, unlike the Group View only one of its children views is visible.
  * The View that is visible is based on the value of the current category.  If category filtering is
  * off then nothing is visible
  *
  * The structure of the Category-based Selector View has the following Top-Level view attributes in additon to
  * those that all views have:
  *
  * - Type = "Category"
  *
  * In terms of children components, the Category-based Selector View has a similar structure  as Group Views.
  * The Views component represent the list of children views used by the Selector.
  * Each child is represented by a View component that includes the following view attributes:
  *
  * - Title - name of the child view
  * - Category - the  value that the category the Filter by Category pull down needs to be set to for
  * this view to be visible
  *
