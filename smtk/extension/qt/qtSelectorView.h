/**\brief Provides the QT UI for a Selector View.
  *
  * A Selector View is similar to a Group View in that it is a set of Views.
  * However, unlike the Group View only one of its children views is visible.
  * The View that is visible is based on the value of a Discrete Item contained
  * in an attribute.  Currently that item should be the only item in the attribute.
  *
  * The structure of the Selector View has the following Top-Level view attributes in additon to
  * those that all views have:
  *
  * - Type = "Selector"
  * - SelectorName - The name of the attribute to be used for selection. if the attribute
  * does not exist it will be created
  * - SelectorType - The name of the selector attribute's definition.
  *
  * In terms of children components, the Selector View has a similar structure  as Group Views.
  * The Views component represent the list of children views used by the Selector.
  * Each child is represented by a View component that includes the following view attributes:
  *
  * - Title - name of the child view
  * - Enum - the enumeration value that the selector attribute's item needs to be set to for
  * this view to be visible
  *
