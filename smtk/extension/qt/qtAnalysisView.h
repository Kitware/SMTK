/**\brief Provides the QT UI for an Analysis View.
  *
  * An Analysis View is a specialized view for choosing the types of analyses the user wants to
  * perform.  These choices are persistent and can be used by an export operation instead of having
  * the operator ask the user what types of analyses should be performed.
  *
  * Unlike other views the Analysis View will construct both an Attribute Definition and
  * corresponding Attribute when needed.  The Attribute Definition is based on the Analysis Information
  * stored in the Attribute Resource.  Any Analysis that is referred to by another will be represented
  * as a Group Item.  All other Analyses will be represented as a Void Item.
  *
  * The View also controls which categories are permitted to be displayed and/or selected.  The set
  * is union of all of the selected Analyses' categories.
  *
  * The following is an example of a Analysis View:
  * ```
  * <View Type="Analysis" Title="Analysis" AnalysisAttributeName="truchasAnalysis" AnalysisAttributeType="truchasAnalysisDefinition">
  * </View>
  * ```
  * AnalysisAttributeType is the name of the Attribute Definition the view will create to represent the
  * Analysis Structure (if needed)
  *
  * AnalysisAttributeName is the name of the Attribute the view will create to represent the
  * Analysis  (if needed)
  *
