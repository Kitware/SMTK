        <DetailedDescription>
          Models that should be intersected with each other.
          If a tool is specified, each workpiece model is intersected independently
          with the tool.
          Otherwise, the workpieces are simultaneously intersected with each other.
          If no tool is specified, at least 2 workpieces must be given.
          Otherwise, 1 or more workpieces is acceptable.

          <BriefDescription>A model to intersect with each of the workpieces in turn.</BriefDescription>
          <DetailedDescription>
            If specificed, the tool is intersected independently with each of the workpieces.
            Otherwise, the workpieces are simultaneously intersected with each other.
            Thus, if a tool is specified, there may be multiple output workpieces which
            only partially overlap.

          <DetailedDescription>
            If true, then copies of the workpieces are intersected and the
            input models are untouched while their intersections are added
            as new models in the session.
            Otherwise, the workpieces are modified and the tool consumed
            by the operation (this is the default).
