          <DetailedDescription>
            Each color in the list is either a canonical color name or
            a hexadecimal RGB string beginning with '#'
            (e.g., "#ff0000" or "#f00" for pure, fully-saturated red).

            An empty list indicates that the color property should be removed
            from each entity.

      <Description>
        Click either the single-color swatch or the palette
        swatch to assign a color to each associated entity.
        If you click on the single-color swatch, every entity will get that color.
        If you click on the palette swatch, every entity will get a different color
        from the palette. When there are more entities than palette colors, some entities
        will get the same palette color.

        You can also click on the swatch with the slash through it to remove any
        previously-assigned color from the associated entities. For now it would not
        remove the color assigned by entity list(In order to do so, when assigning a color
        to entity list you should just click Cancel button in the dialog).

        You can pick a new color for the single-color swatch or a new palette for
        the palette swatch by clicking the buttons below the swatches, respectively.
        Once you choose a new value, it is immediately applied to all the associated
        entities.
