/**\brief Different types of entities the model can hold and their inherent properties.
  *
  * This enum is used to specify entity types as well as masks for
  * various operations on entities (e.g., determining suitability
  * for group membership).
  *
  * Entity types are stored as bit vectors (of type smtk::model::BitFlags)
  * whose bits are values from this enumeration.
  *
  * The lower 5 bits are reserved for entity dimensionality (DIMENSION_0 through
  * DIMENSION_4). These do not refer to specific dimensions but rather indicate
  * the number of dimensions required to parameterize the point locus of the
  * entity.
  * Shell entities have 2 dimension bits set: the dimension of their
  * boundary and the dimension of the space they enclose.
  * Groups use these bits to constrain membership.
  * Instances need not have any of these bits set.
  * All other entities should have exactly one of these bits set.
  * (For models, this bit indicates the maximum *parametric* dimension
  * of any entity contained in the model.)
  *
  * The next 8 bits are reserved for entity types (currently only 6 are used).
  * Every entity should have exactly one of these bits set, except group
  * entities which may use the other bits to indicate constraints on membership.
  *
  * The next 8 bits identify immutable properties of entities.
  * COVER and PARTITION may be applied to group entities to indicate that they
  * must form a (not necessarily disjoint) cover or (precisely disjoint) partition
  * of the point-locus their top-level member describes. The COVER and PARTITION
  * bits are mutually exclusive.
  * A group with the COVER bit set may have subgroups that overlap.
  * The union of the subgroups is the space covered.
  * A group with the PARTITION bit set must have subgroups that do not overlap.
  * The union of the subgroups is the space partitioned.
  *
  * The OPEN and CLOSED bits indicate that the point-set of the designated
  * aentities should be considered as OPEN (not containing its closure)
  * or CLOSED (containing its closure). This is largely intended for marking
  * groups to indicate that, for example, if a FaceEntity is in a CLOSED group
  * then its bounding edges and vertices should also be considered members
  * of the group. However, it may be used in the future to accommodate
  * modeling kernels that represent point locii differently than SMTK by
  * marking topological entities themselves (rather than groups).
  *
  * The MODEL_DOMAIN and MODEL_BOUNDARY bits are intended to be
  * set on groups to constrain their membership to items to the
  * dimensionality of the model to which the group belongs.
  *
  * The HOMOGENOUS_GROUP bit indicates that a group should
  * contain entities of the same type.
  *
  * Finally, because groups may have entity-type bits (e.g. CELL_ENTITY)
  * other than GROUP_ENTITY set in order to constrain membership, this
  * bit can be used to indicate whether or not the group may contain
  * other groups.
  *
  * Besides these bits, there are many enumerants that combine bits
  * into meaningful specifications for entities:
  * VERTEX (CELL_0D),    EDGE (CELL_1D),      FACE (CELL_2D),      VOLUME (CELL_3D),
  * VERTEX_USE (USE_0D), EDGE_USE (USE_1D),   FACE_USE (USE_2D),   USE_3D,
  * CHAIN (SHELL_0D),    LOOP (SHELL_0D),     SHELL (SHELL_2D),
  * GROUP_0D,            GROUP_1D,            GROUP_2D,            GROUP_3D,
  * BOUNDARY_GROUP, and  DOMAIN_GROUP.
  *
  * There are also enumerants meant to be used as masks to
  * separate out bits into functional groups:
  * ANY_DIMENSION, ENTITY_MASK, ANY_ENTITY, ANY_GROUP, ANY_SHELL,
  * ANY_CELL, ANY_USE, and GROUP_CONSTRAINT_MASK.
  *
  * Finally, the INVALID enumerant indicates that an entity does not
  * exist or should be considered ill-posed.

/**\brief Enumerate how model domains are represented.

  * PARAMETRIC models have cells that are assumed to have a
  * parameter-space domain mapped to world coordinates by a
  * smooth curve or surface, usually described with a single
  * piecewise-continuous spline per entity.
  * Their display tessellations are not required to be
  * conformal (water-tight) and generally aren't.
  *
  * DISCRETE models are piecewise linear cell complexes
  * with no explicit parameter-space (although these are
  * easy to generate) whose geometry is exactly represented
  * by the display tessellation, which is required to be
  * conformal. Each entity has 1 or more geometric primitives
  * that, taken together, specify the point locus of the
  * entity is world coordinates.

  * be supported eventually; do not treat this enumeration
