class Manager;

/// This class describes a stateless object associated with an operation manager
/// that provides a unified API for grouping, ungrouping and querying operation
/// groups. The persistent data associated with operation groups is held in the
/// operation's specification, and is accessed only in the context of an
/// operation's association with a manager (i.e. operations that are not
/// registered with a manager do not have the concept of groups).
///
/// The design isolates the notion of operator grouping to the application scope
/// of SMTK; operations are designed to be added to groups when they are
/// registered to a manager, and an application subsequently performs operation
/// group queries through the manager's interface.
///
/// A group is simply a string value used to associate collections of operations
/// for aggregate manipulation (e.g. read operations that need to be associated
/// with the File->Open menu command). The API presented here is extremely
/// flexible, allowing for any number (including 0) of strings to be associated
/// to an operator within the context of the group. To prevent the misuse of
/// groups in an ad-hoc fashion for attaching custom data to operations, it is
/// highly recommended that this class be subclassed privately, and a narrowing
/// API for that group's context be used on top of this one. See
/// smtk::operation::ReaderGroup for an example of this use case.
