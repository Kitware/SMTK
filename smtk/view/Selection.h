/**\brief A class to manage linked selections in a context.
  *
  * This class allows multiple UI elements to share a selection
  * by providing methods to modify and filter the selection as
  * well as receive signals when the selection is updated by others.
  *
  * The major use case is to support a single, application-wide
  * selection but it is possible to create multiple instances
  * of this class if your application wishes to manage different
  * selections depending upon some context.
  * The instance() method supports application-wide
  * selections by returning the first selection instance which has
  * been created (or creates a new instance if its weak pointer is
  * null).
  *
  * ## The Nature of Selections
  *
  * A selection is a map from PersistentObjects to
  * integers that indicate the _type_ of selection that the
  * object is participating in.
  * Integers are application-specific and managed in this
  * class by registering them.
  * Applications are free to interpret the integer as a
  * bitmask, so that the same object may be in multiple
  * selections at a time; or as a unique values that indicate
  * the "level of selection" for each object.
  * An example of the latter would be an application that
  * registers 1 to indicate a transient highlight to preview
  * mouseovers and 2 to indicate permanent selection.
  * The latter is how modelbuilder uses SMTK selections.
  *
  * When an object is assigned the special integer 0,
  * the object is considered "unselected" and is removed
  * from the map.
  *
  * ## Lifecycle
  *
  * First, your application should create a selection instance for
  * each separate context in which a separate selection is allowed.
  * If your application will be making changes to resources by
  * invoking operators, you should register the operation manager with
  * the selection so that as persistent objects are created and
  * destroyed the selection can be updated.
  *
  * After creating a selection, each UI element of your
  * application that will (a) share the selection and (b) modify
  * the selection should register itself as a source of selections
  * by providing a unique string name to registerSelectionSource().
  *
  * Similarly, each UI element of your application that will (a) share
  * the selection and (b) present the selection or otherwise need to
  * be informed of changes to the selection should register as an
  * observer by providing a callback to observe().
  *
  * ## Selection Events
  *
  * When the selection changes, Observer functions subscribed to
  * updates will be called with the name of the UI elements that
  * caused the event (or "selection" if a change inside the
  * selection itself caused the event). A pointer to the selection
  * is also provided so you can query the selection
  * inside the Observer function. You should **not** modify
  * the selection inside a Observer as that can cause infinite
  * recursion.
  *
  * The Observer may be called under a variety of circumstances:
  *
  * + upon initial registration with the selection (if
  *   \a immediatelyNotify is passed as true),
  * + upon modification by a selection source
  * + upon a change to the selection's filter that
  *   results in a change to the selection.
  *
  * While Observers are not usually informed when attempted
  * changes to the selection have no effect, it is possible
  * to get called when the selection is entirely replaced with
  * an identical selection.
